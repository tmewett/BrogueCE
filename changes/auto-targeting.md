- When using a staff or wand, enemies that always reflect bolts (stone/winged guardian, non-negated mirror totem) will no longer be auto-targeted.
- When hallucinating but not telepathic, auto-targeting behavior has changed in two ways. First, an initial target will no longer be selected when using a staff or wand whose kind isn't known. Second, the tab key will have no effect. The previous behavoir leaked information about which creatures are allies.
 - When using a staff or wand, the tab key will now cycle through additional targets (if any) only if an initial target was selected.
 - When using a known staff of tunneling, turrets and sentinels will now be auto-targeted.
 - If a wand or staff of unknown kind has been magic detected, auto-targeting will now target enemies or allies accordingly.
 - Monsters that are immune to fire are no longer auto-targeted when using a firebolt staff or throwing an incendiary dart or known potion of incineration.
 - Monsters that are immune to weapon damage are no longer auto-targeted when throwing a dart or javelin, or using a staff of conjuration.
 - When using a known wand of domination, monsters at full health will not longer be auto-targeted.
 - When using a known wand of negation, monsters that will not be affected will no longer be auto-targeted.
 - When using a known wand of beckoning, monsters that are adjacent to the player will no longer be auto-targeted.
 - When using a known staff of healing, non-reflective allies at full health will no longer be auto-targeted.
 - When throwing a known potion of confusion or caustic gas, unaffected enemies will no longer be auto-targeted.
