Revamped the searching system. Instead of performing a strong search only after
five consecutive turns of pressing 's', you now perform a weaker, single-turn
search every time you press 's', with a stronger one on the fifth. (Control+s
will perform five searches, stopping if interrupted, just like old 'S'.)
