Resurrection altars now function differently for phoenixes and liches. The phoenix egg or phylactery will be revived instead, and the ability to turn into a phoenix or lich restored. Similarly, a vampire's ability to spawn vampire bats will be restored. Monsters that are summoned by allies (furies, phantoms, vampire bats) are no longer eligible for resurrection. Only the summoner will be resurrected. Also, destroying a phoenix egg or phylactery now counts toward weapon auto-id.
