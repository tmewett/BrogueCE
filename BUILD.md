Building Brogue CE
==================

You need these things to compile the game:

- a C compiler (Clang or GCC)
- GNU Make
- anything extra listed in `config.mk` that you require

Once you have those, the game is built by running `make` (or `gmake` on
BSD systems). You can configure the build by editing `config.mk` or
appending options to the Make command,
e.g. `make TERMINAL=YES`.

More specific instructions follow on how to acquire the dependencies and
build the game.


Windows
-------

There are many ways to compile software on Windows. The method here was
tested by the author and is relatively simple.

### Setting up

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) for x86_64. Refer to the
[introduction](https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/MSYS2-introduction)
for essential info on how to use it.

2. (Installing the dependencies) Open the MSYS2 shell and run the following:

    ```
    pacman -S make mingw-w64-x86_64-{gcc,SDL2,SDL2_image}
    ```

### Building

1. (Compiling the game) Open the Mingw64 shell. Navigate to the Brogue CE
directory (the one containing this file; your Windows drives can be accessed
at `/c`, `/d` etc.) and run

    ```
    make bin/brogue.exe
    ```

2. Optional: You can now run the game by running `cd bin;
./brogue.exe`. However if you want to be able to run it from
outside the Mingw64 shell, you'll need to add the `/mingw64/bin`
directory of MSYS2 to your system PATH. By default this is at
`C:\msys2\mingw64\bin`. Some info is here: [How do I set or change the PATH
system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) You only
need to perform this step once.

Linux
-----

These instructions are for the graphical version only.

### Setting up

1. Install the dependencies; for example, on Debian/Ubuntu, run

    ```
    sudo apt install make gcc libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-dev
    ```

### Building

1. Navigate to where this file is and run

    ```
    make bin/brogue
    ```
