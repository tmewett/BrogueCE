/*  This file contains constants associated with game objects,
 *  including colors and material descriptions. The file also
 *  contains large tables (e.g. tileCatalog) that consist of
 *  constant data associated with game objects, including creation
 *  probabilities, descriptions and in-game attributes.
 *
 *  Where possible the tables are defined as const arrays,
 *  because the data typically is not dynamic. Some tables,
 *  however, also store some mutable flags, so cannot be made
 *  constant.  For tables that are
 *  variant-specific (e.g. autoGeneratorCatalog), the tables are
 *  declared as pointers (again typically const * since the data
 *  contained is constant).
 *
 *  These tables are defined on a per-variant basis in
 *  Globals{variant}.c. When a variant is selected, the pointers
 *  declared in this file are set to the definitions in the chosen
 *  Globals{variant}.c file.
