The tiles were originally created by Antony Boucher, based heavily on the tiles
from Oryx Design Lab's "Brogue Tiles" <https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/games>
which were distributed with the game under the AGPL license (which can be found
in the root directory of this project.)

If you like them, a commercially-licensed expanded tile set can be found here:
