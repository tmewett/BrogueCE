Brogue CE for iPad OS
=====================

Playing
-------

To run the iPad OS app, just start the app as usual. If you have an attached
keyboard, either one directly connected or one connected via Bluetooth, you can
use that in addition to on-screen touches to control your rogue, or to enter
commands.   


### In-game movement and screen touches

The "compass rose" figure on the left lower side of the screen can be used to
direct your rogue by tapping or holding down one "arrow" of the compass in the
direction you wish to move. Also, you can touch the game screen directly. A
screen touch will first highlight a path to a location, showing what is there,
and then when confirmed with another touch your rogue will follow the path. If
you need to cancel an action, drag your finger till it highlights your rogue,
then lift it off safely.

If you are using an attached keyboard, Vi/Nethack keyboard movements (i.e.
h,j,k,l,y,u,b,n) may be used in addition to the "compass rose".  Arrow keys and
the keypad arrows are also accepted.

The keywords along the bottom are also touch sensitive.
